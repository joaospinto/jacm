\section{Conclusion}

We have shown that the Matrix-Exponential Problem is undecidable in general, but decidable when the matrices $A_{1}, \ldots, A_{k}$ commute. We have also showed that the Matrix-Exponential Semigroup Problem is undecidable, by designing a gadget to enforce an order in the products, and derived the undecidability of the generalised versions of the Continuous Orbit and Continuous Skolem Problems to a multi-matrix setting. This is analogous to what was known for the discrete version of this problem, in which the matrix exponentials $e^{At}$ are replaced by matrix powers $A^n$. Finally, we show that these problems are in $\Sigma_{1}$ if Schanuel's conjecture is true, and in $\Sigma_{2}$ unconditionally. It would be interesting to show membership in $\Sigma_{1}$ unconditionally. In the discrete version of the problem, membership in $\Sigma_{1}$ follows trivially from the countability of the space of candidate solutions.

It would be interesting to look at possibly decidable restrictions of the MEP/MESP, for example the case where $k=2$ with a non-commuting pair of matrices, which was shown to be decidable for the discrete analogue of this problem in~\cite{MEHTP}. Bounding the dimension of the ambient vector space could also yield decidability, which has been partly accomplished in the discrete case in~\cite{PS2Z}.

Finally, deriving upper and lower bounds for the computational complexity of the commutative case of this problem would also be a worthwhile task.
