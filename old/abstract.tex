    Given $k+1$ square matrices $A_{1}, \ldots, A_{k}, C$, all of the same dimension and with real algebraic coordinates, we examine the problem of deciding whether there exist matrices of the form $\exp(A_{i} t_{j})$ whose product equals $C$. We show that this is undecidable in general, but decidable if $A_{1}, \ldots, A_{k}$ commute.

The decidability proof relies on a number of theorems from algebraic and transcendental number theory, most notably those of Baker, Lindemann, and Masser, as well as some useful geometric and linear-algebraic results, including the Minkowski-Weyl theorem and a new (to the best of our knowledge) result about the uniqueness of strictly upper triangular matrix logarithms of upper unitriangular matrices.
On the other hand, the undecidability result is shown by reduction from Hilbert's Tenth Problem, through a series of matrix constructions.

We also establish the undecidability of the multi-matrix generalisations of the Continuous Skolem and Continuous Orbit problems.

Our results have applications to reachability problems for linear hybrid automata.
